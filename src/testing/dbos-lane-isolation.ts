/**
 * PER-LANE DBOS SYSTEM-SCHEMA ISOLATION for this repo's e2e specs.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. Ten e2e specs in this repo launch the REAL DBOS runtime in-process and
 * enqueue the REAL workflows onto the REAL shared queues — while the root Compose `dbos`
 * container may be running the SAME image, registering the SAME static workflow names on
 * the SAME queues. Nothing distinguishes the two: `executor_id` is `"local"` for both (and
 * is a recovery filter, never a dequeue filter), and the in-process worker's auto-computed
 * application version MATCHES the container's, because it is computed from the same code.
 * Enqueues carry `application_version = NULL`, and the SDK's dequeue predicate is
 *
 *     WHERE status = $1 AND queue_name = $2
 *       AND (application_version IS NULL OR application_version = $3)
 *
 * A NULL-version row is therefore dequeuable by ANY executor polling that queue, so the
 * container can win the race for work this lane enqueued. That is worse here than in the
 * api repo: the crash/replay specs KILL or CANCEL the in-process worker mid-workflow and
 * then assert no duplicated side effects — but if the container is the executor that
 * actually resumed the workflow, the exactly-once proof is measuring the wrong process.
 * The precondition "keep the Compose `dbos` service idle" is unsatisfiable across a
 * full sweep, since the root repo's own e2e lane and nextjs's render lane both bring
 * `dbos` UP and leave it up on purpose.
 *
 * THE FIX. Point the in-process runtime AND the DBOSClient at a per-lane SCHEMA inside the
 * SAME `supagloo_dbos` database, via the SDK's own `systemDatabaseSchemaName`. The two
 * executors then read and write disjoint `workflow_status` tables, so neither can see the
 * other's rows IN EITHER DIRECTION. Note what is deliberately NOT done:
 *
 *   • NOT `appVersion` pinning — the predicate's `IS NULL` disjunction means a
 *     version-pinned stand-in would still steal NULL-versioned REAL enqueues. That is
 *     worse than the bug being fixed.
 *   • NOT a third database — the documented topology is two logical databases, and a
 *     schema keeps that sentence true.
 *   • NOT runtime-constructed queue or workflow names — static registration is a hard
 *     constraint of `src/dbos/registry.ts`, and the real shared names are exactly what
 *     these specs exist to prove.
 *   • NOT a conditional skip or a warn — a lane must never mark itself optional. The
 *     `assert*` helpers below are POSITIVE proof that isolation is in effect, so a future
 *     regression that drops the config fails loudly instead of silently re-coupling.
 *
 * The schema self-provisions: the SDK's first system migration is
 * `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS "<schemaName>"`, so no Compose or Postgres change is needed.
 *
 * A NEAR-IDENTICAL COPY LIVES AT `supagloo-nodejs-api/src/testing/dbos-lane-isolation.ts`.
 * That duplication is deliberate, not drift: routing this through the root checkout would
 * make api specs that need no root checkout today depend on one. The copies cannot
 * meaningfully diverge — the two repos MUST NOT share a lane schema name, and each lane
 * wants its own regardless.
